# Data Structures in the Kernel
This is a small lab assignment that implements some data structures using kernel memory. The uncommented data structures work for the most part, linkedlist2 will cause issues if uncommented.

# Warning
I do not reccomend doing this outside of a virtual machine.

# Instructions
Build the project using the Makefile and insert the kernel module. 
Upon insertion the module will run a sample of data structures and print out results to dmesg.
